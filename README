IBM Capstone Project
Welcome to my data analytics capstone project focused on IBM! Within this project, I undertake the role of a Data Analyst for a prominent international IT and business consulting organization recognized for its excellence in IT solutions and its cadre of highly skilled IT professionals.

Project Overview
The organization frequently conducts data analysis to forecast future skill requirements, ensuring competitiveness and adaptability to swiftly evolving technologies. As a data analyst, my responsibility is to gather information from diverse sources and discern trends for this year's report on skill development.

Project Process
Each phase of the data analysis process is meticulously documented in the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository.

Week 1: Data Collection
The initial task involves compiling a comprehensive list of the most sought-after programming skills from job postings, training platforms, surveys, and other outlets. This process entails employing web scraping methods and leveraging APIs to amass data in varied formats, including .csv files, Excel spreadsheets, and databases.

Week 2: Data Wrangling
Data wrangling techniques are applied to refine and prepare the collected data for analysis, ensuring its integrity and suitability for exploration.

Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
With a refined dataset at hand, statistical methods are employed to delve into the data and extract meaningful insights.

Week 4: Data Visualization
Utilizing visualization tools, I create an array of charts and graphs to visually represent the analyzed data, facilitating the identification of trends and patterns.

Week 5: Building a Dashboard
Leveraging IBM Cognos Analytics, I construct a dynamic dashboard that consolidates the data, offering insights into trends such as the most in-demand programming languages, database skills, and popular IDEs.

Week 6: Presentation of Findings
In the final week, I employ storytelling techniques to present my findings in an engaging and comprehensive manner.

Conclusion
This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in data analytics, showcasing my ability to derive actionable insights from data to drive informed decision-making. Thank you for exploring this repository!
